            <h2>The Invasion</h2>
            <h4>Super-Intelligent beings from another solar system have attacked Earth, ending life as we know it. Cities lie in ruin. Humanity has been eradicated. Small bands of survivors remain, scavenging out an existence in a harsh, post-civilization world. We attempt to recruit more people into our resistance through this website, and if you have found it we need you. Aliens have taken down most of human technology and websites but the aliens cannot access this site, only we can enter this site. This site has all the information you will need on surviving human camps, alien life-forms including their weaknesses, strengths and methods to fight them, and also how to find and contact groups of survivors.

                If you are reading this we wish you luck, and may god have mercy on your soul.</h4>
